# Frontend Test
So we can get an understanding of how you would approach a development task; using the following [API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).

We would like you to use the [Angular](http://angular.io/) framework, to consume this API and list out a selection of movies on a single page we will call a listing page. If you have not used the Angular framework, do not worry, this is a chance for you to demonstrate your ability to follow steps in a process. 

We would like the app to have the following features -
* Ability to click on a given movie and it link through to another page with details of that given movie. We will call this page a single movie page.
* Ability to see the title, description and rating on the listing page only if possible.
* Ability to see image,title, description, directors, actors and rating on the single movie page if possible.

While this test is focusing more on how you would handle data from an API; we will also be looking at how you structure your HTML in the template and would like some style added to both the listing and single movie page. Style is subjective so don't worry about how it looks, we will only be focusing on your use of CSS/SASS.
